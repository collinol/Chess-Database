<h1> Collin's Data Warehousing for Analysis </h1>
<hr>


<font size = "5"> One interesting analysis would be to see if there's a correlation between player's ratings each year, and how many games and or tournaments they win.
 I would need to extract data from the tables 'isRatedIn', 'Player', 'Games', 'Matches' and perhaps 'TournamentOccurrence'.
From this collected data, we could year v. number of wins, year v. finishing place of a tournament, etc, and compare those trends to the trend of year v. rating to see if there's a visible correlation <br><hr></font>


<font size = "5"> 
Another interesting analysis would be to look into which players are strongly affected by the type of game they play. I'd like to look at the data from 'Games', 'Player' and 'GameTypes' to see try to determine the player's who's win/loss outcome is most affected by how style of game that's being played. Granted, for this data, it wouldn't actually tell us anything because all the games have been assigned a randomized "game type" and although some of these matchups between players actually did occur, the game type was randomly generated. But it would be something that I'm sure would produce some interesting visible results if the data was accurate
